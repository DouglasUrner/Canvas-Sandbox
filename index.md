# index.md

Lots of text so that I can see how long lines are rendered and also what happens if the page size changes. I should also put an image in as well. Of the three options for the source file – index.html, index.md, and README.md – I thing it makes the most sense to use index.md (since that can also include HTML).

There are also three choices of "where" to look for the files:

* The root of the repo.
* The gh_pages branch, and
* A docs folder in the root, if enabled in Settings.
